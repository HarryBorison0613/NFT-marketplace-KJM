don't you push to live site?
Erebus — 03/19/2022
no
Can you make show on marketplace?
If for sale
even if not in moralis?

Happy birthday @Strop
Strop — 03/19/2022
thank you again
see you laterBenny
Strop — 03/20/2022
okay
it will be uniswap fork?
Erebus — 03/20/2022
i dont know
we have dex on Nova Network
so we will use whatever that is
Strop — 03/20/2022
okay
I have an idea for total volume
Erebus — 03/20/2022
good idea?
Strop — 03/20/2022
save totalVolum for each tokens on thegraph
and we can calculate it on backend or frontend
Erebus — 03/20/2022
easy to do?
Strop — 03/20/2022
just idea. will research more
Erebus — 03/20/2022
okay
just let me know if its doable
Strop — 03/20/2022
okay

just pushewhy does it have problems on some iOS and some mobile
nevermind
Strop — Yesterday at 4:58 AM
I think it's because of the network load
Erebus — Yesterday at 4:58 AM
work on dex for now
we need to find an efficient way to do it for mobile users
Strop — Yesterday at 4:58 AM
on metamask browser, it will increase
Erebus — Yesterday at 4:59 AM
yea we need to find a way to make it more mobile optimized
Strop — Yesterday at 4:59 AM
okay
Erebus — Yesterday at 4:59 AM
nftkey does fine and paintswap on mobile
but work on dex until we know how to fix opera house
Strop — Yesterday at 4:59 AM
okay
Strop — Yesterday at 6:14 AM
just pushed to dex
Erebus — Yesterday at 6:15 AM
Okay I will sleep now
Will check tomorrow
Strop — Yesterday at 6:15 AM
okay
then let's finish today
7 hours for today
Erebus — Yesterday at 6:16 AM
Okay
Erebus — Yesterday at 5:12 PM
@Strop are you awake?
Erebus — Yesterday at 5:53 PM
i need your help on something easy, I am having a hard morning, brain is working like 50%
Strop — Yesterday at 6:54 PM
Hello 
Erebus — Yesterday at 7:19 PM
nevermind i think i fixed it
Strop — Yesterday at 7:39 PM
okay
Strop — Yesterday at 7:48 PM

Hello, @ZNX
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:27 PM
Hey @Strop Sorry haven't seen the chat
Been a bit busy here
just pushed
please check @Erebus 
Erebus — 03/20/2022
just collection page messed up?
Strop — 03/20/2022
oh, sorry
will push again
Erebus — 03/20/2022

Erebus — 03/20/2022

Strop — 03/20/2022
Image
Erebus — 03/20/2022
oh okay
thank you
Strop — 03/20/2022
no need for erc721
I'm starting it right now, will tell you in a bit
Strop — 03/28/2022
okay
ZNX — 03/28/2022
Just pushed the new fork-modules there
No, it's not showing the tokens here, but I think it's because of cache
Is it possible for us to add a default trading pair for each network? For example, when the user clicks on Fantom, it will show FTM on top and SNT on the bottom, instead of only FTM
And when user is on Nova Network, it could have SNT on top and WSNT in the bottom
Strop — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
okay
I've removed v1 trade on dex.
after that, the swap function is working well
I am just adding aggregator contract now
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:29 PM
Okay, I'm pulling here and will run it to see how it's going
We will probably need to work a bit on the aggregator contract
To see if we can reduce the gas usage
It's a bit too high at the moment
Strop — Yesterday at 11:30 PM
yes. I know it is why
I think we need to select proper router address on frontend
not in contract function
it is increasing gas usage now
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:31 PM
Wouldn't that create a vulnerability though?
Let me think about it for a moment
Because if we do that, any user could simply use the developers' console to change it
And mask the calculations, and the router address
Is this what you have done for Opera House? 
Strop — Yesterday at 11:32 PM
yes. you are right
Erebus — Yesterday at 11:33 PM
I hope thats not a vulnerability on opera house
Strop — Yesterday at 11:33 PM
but I think that is not vulnerability
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:33 PM
Let me think it through before we decide what to do
Strop — Yesterday at 11:34 PM
okay
Erebus — Yesterday at 11:34 PM
i
or example i could attempt to exploit on opera houses front end, but the blockchain would reject it
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
I'm thinking it for the DEX, and it's more so leaving it open for fishing attacks
Strop — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
whichever router address users use for swap, we can get fee from them.
no risk there, I think
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
So for example a malicious user makes it in a way it can send a link to another user, which will use the original site, but with the formulas changed to - for example - send the txn to their own malicious router contract, which could then steal the funds
Strop — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
and we can revert if not available router address
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
I'm not a security expert, but it was just the first thing that came to mind when you said that
Erebus — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
I dont think that would work
Strop — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
like this : require(isAvailableRouter(address), '...')
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:37 PM
In this example, the txn wouldn't even pass through our router, it would go directly to the hacker's contract, so any protection built into our own contract, would be bypassed
It might be nothing, but I just want to think a little bit about it
Erebus — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
wouldnt cloudflare stop that attempt?
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
Because as it can be nothing, it can also be a very easy exploit
Strop — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
okay
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
No, it goes through as a legitimate request
Strop — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
it is just blockchain request. just web3
ZNX — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
Just give me 15 minutes to think and research a little bit 
Erebus — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
my internet security experience goes only as far as php lol
Strop — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
okay. @ZNX
Strop — Today at 12:30 AM
?
waiting for @ZNX
Erebus — Today at 12:32 AM
@ZNX
ZNX — Today at 12:37 AM
Sorry, was on a phone call
So yes, I couldn't really find a good way for this to be exploited
If you change things around on the console, those changes are lost as soon as the page is refreshed
So I couldn't really create a link that could be used for fishing
Should be fine @Strop
But we definitely should have require(isAllowedRouter(address)... or something like it in our contract, just as a protection mechanism, and also add the reentrancy guard 
Strop — Today at 12:40 AM
okay
ZNX — Today at 12:40 AM
And on the front-end, what we could do as a simple extra security step, is to disable the dev console for the live site
I've done it on NovaPro
Strop — Today at 12:40 AM
so need to make new abbegator contract now?
ZNX — Today at 12:40 AM
And users are simply not able to use the console
Strop — Today at 12:41 AM
prevent right clicking?
ZNX — Today at 12:41 AM
You can make both, right clicking, F12, and console
ZNX — Today at 12:43 AM
Let's streamline the process, so I can also work on the UI elements while you keep on developing. So first, add the current aggregator contract we already have, and then you go doing the other tasks (NFT page etc etc), and once we are done with that, you come back and redo the aggregator contract and change the front-end to accommodate it.
Strop — Today at 12:43 AM
okay
ZNX — Today at 12:44 AM
This way I'm able to work with you and get the UI done while you are making the new contract, and don't have to keep on waiting you to finish the contract for that
Strop — Today at 12:44 AM
okay
ZNX — Today at 12:45 AM
Do you think we will need a backend for anything we're doing with the DEX? Or will it be just a front-end app?
Strop — Today at 12:46 AM
for now, I think it will be frontend app
but not sure for bridge and farming
Strop
 started a call that lasted a few seconds.
 — Today at 12:46 AM
Strop — Today at 12:47 AM
sorry
ZNX — Today at 12:47 AM
All g
Okay, farming doesn't need backend, can be done all with a couple .json files
I'm asking because if we need a backend, I would lease a new VPS, but since we're not, that's all right then, we can carry on as we are
Strop — Today at 12:48 AM
okay
ZNX — Today at 12:48 AM
All right, I will let you work now, and let us know if you need anything else
Strop — Today at 12:49 AM
okay. I will
Strop — Today at 1:21 AM
I will be back in an hour
ZNX — Today at 1:21 AM
Okay
Strop — Today at 1:21 AM
I am just finding way to integrate with abbregator 
I think we need to make new functions on abbregater contract to use current project structure.
ZNX — Today at 1:38 AM
Hmm, if that's the case might be worth to have the contract remade now then, even if that means a bit longer until I manage to get the UI done
I will be out for a few hours, but @Erebus can give you a hand if you need I think
Strop — Today at 2:04 AM
okay. I will check again if we can use current contract
ZNX — Today at 2:08 AM
@Strop
This is the VPS Opera House is using, right? https://216.250.127.148:10000/
Erebus — Today at 2:10 AM
yes
ZNX — Today at 2:10 AM
Ok
